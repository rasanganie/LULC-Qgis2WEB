As part of our WebGIS Module, we practiced creating web sites that integrate spatial information. The primary goal was to learn how to transform shapefiles into JSON files, which are useful for web-based mapping applications.



We used the **Qgis2WEB plugin** within QGIS, which is a powerful tool for rapidly converting shapefiles into interactive web maps. This plugin generates web-ready HTML, JavaScript, and JSON files.


This exercise gave participants hands-on experience translating GIS data for web use and indicated the potential for integrating spatial information into web applications to increase accessibility and interaction.# LULC-Qgis2WEB
